## Description
Given a sheet of paper, price change log, take a photo of it by clicking a barcode button on the top right corner, and it will load all the images of items for you, categorized by each brand.

## What was your motivation?
This project is to make my life easier at work - Softmoc... Typing item ids just to check images of shoes is horrendous!!

## How to install this project
At this point in time, I don't have an Apple Developer Acccount. So you will need to download Xcode in order to install the app.

## How to use it
### Prerequisite
Before you begin, make sure your phone is CONNECTED to Wi-fi because it will need to download good amount of data.
### Main
In the setting tab, you will need to hit "Load Button". You can't miss it. There are only two buttons. It will take time, but what it will do is that it will download all the items' images in Core Data.
After that, as mentioned above, go back to "Price Change Log" tab, and click the barcode button in the right upper corner, and scan the "Price Change Log" document, and voila. It will load up the shoe images.
